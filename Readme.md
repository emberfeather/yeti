Simple snowball debt calculator for illustrating faster debt repayment.

This project is an exercise in the following:

  *  Helping people get out of debt.
  *  Using HTML5 and CSS3 technologies.
  *  Simplifying the snowball process.
  *  Having fun!

## Prerequisites

At a minimum, you will need the following tools installed:

1. [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
2. [Grow](https://grow.io)

If you do not have Grow, you can install it using:

```
curl https://install.growsdk.org | bash
```

## Running the development server

Prior to starting the development server, you may have to install dependencies used by your project. The `grow install` command walks you through this and tries to set up your environment for you.

The `grow run` command starts your development server. You can make changes to your project files and refresh to see them reflected immediately.

```
grow install
grow run
```

## Contributing

If you feel like contributing to the project you can fork the repository and make a pull request of the changes.

The [issues][issues] page has a list of the things that are planned *'sometime'* in the future.
